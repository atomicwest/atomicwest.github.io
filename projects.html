		<u> Volunteer Manager App</u><br>
			I worked with after-school K-12 programs in San Francisco and Oakland as an undergrad, while also interacting with different groups on campus. One potentially troublesome thing that occurred 
			everyday was tracking attendance, especially for those who were participating for credit over the 
			course of the semester. The idea behind the Volunteer Manager is to have an easy way to track 
			attendance in addition to other aspects of the daily schedule, such as organizing transportation 
			to and from volunteer sites. Furthermore, organizations will have the flexibility of shaping the 
			app to meet their specific needs, such as if volunteers are required to fill out progress sheets 
			for one-on-one tutoring.</p><br>

		<u> Wearable Electronics: Halloween Mask and Gloves </u><br>
			Using some cardboard, PVC sheet, foam, fabric, and lots of tape, I added a simple LED array
			to create my Halloween costume. The character, Haunter, is stylized as a cartoonish ghost, which made it easier
			to accept ragged/rough cuts in the fabric and to pull off the overall look.

			<br><img src="resources/images/hlight_wear.png" alt=" " style="width: 50%; max-height: 30%"/>
			<br>Unfortunately, I did not properly align the LEDs and fabric eye openings, so there appears to be
			some extra glow outside of the eyes. The LEDs were powered by 3V, which was enough.
			<br><img src="resources/images/hLEDarray.png" alt=" " style="width: 50%; max-height: 30%"/>
			<br>Finally, I soldered some more LEDs for a simple light effect on a pair of gloves. Given more time,
			I would have hoped to make the entire glove and mask uniformly glow, but I was satisfied with the result.

		<u> Wearable Electronics: Motorized Helmet and Driver-controlled  LEDs</u> <br>
			The dollar store has some hit-or-miss stock, but I found an obvious Star Wars knockoff item that I hope 
			to turn into a fully "servo'd" helmet that opens up in an Iron Man fashion. I am currently working out
			a three-piece open/close mechanism, more so for form than function. Updated previsualizations will be
			up soon.

		<u> Master's Practicum: IoT Infant Monitor</u><br>
			Our group wanted to add an extra level of connectivity to commercially-available baby monitors, 
			specifically for addressing Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and alerting to parents when 
			breathing has stopped. After interviewing parents, one issue that came up was the abrupt nature of 
			monitor alarms that might occur for false readings. We wanted to utilize mobile technology to 
			enable the parent to receive alerts, for example, even if the parent were outside in the yard 
			while the baby was napping indoors. We produced a prototype that sent SMS text alerts to parents' 
			phones when detected breathing dropped for about 20 seconds. If a parent wanted to see their 
			child's breathing rate in real-time, I created a simple webpage integrated with Plotly that 
			graphed our physical sensor data. Ideally, a single, fully developed app would be responsible for 
			receiving alerts and displaying breathing data, but our time constraints limited us to separate 
			native SMS and web page data display. <br>
