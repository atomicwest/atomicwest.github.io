Working Title: Cat and Mouse

2 player game, where each player is allied with opposing factions; one controlling the mech and another controlling the air unit. (A more nuanced story can be fleshed out later)

The idea is that the mech has the noticeable disadvantage; the air unit has greater speed/coverage and degrees of movement. However, the mech utilizes the cover of the abandoned outpost map to wear out the air unit. The map has features such as anti-air turrets and false ID signature jammers to mislead the air unit's scanners.

The air unit is constrained by such things as fuel resources, and must land at designated fuel ports if flying for too long. In these moments, the mech can launch a sneak attack.

And so the cat and mouse game is summed up by two units trying to destroy each other but using their inherent abilities, the terrain, and power-ups to leverage their weaknesses.

Although mostly for combat between these two vehicle units, potential future additions can be pilots who can depart the vehicle and attack on foot.
